    <p>One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively 
        depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. 
        Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought 
        for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions of 
        lions were prominent in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval 
        cultures in the lion's historic and current range.</p>
